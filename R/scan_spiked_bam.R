#' pretty much what it says: scan standard chroms + spike contigs from a BAM
#' 
#' @param bam       the BAM file  
#' @param mapq      minimum mapq value to count a pair (20) 
#' @param binwidth  width of the bins for chromosomal tiling (300) 
#' @param bins      a pre-tiled GRanges for binning coverage (NULL)
#' @param spike     the spike-in references, if not using the defaults (NULL) 
#' @param how       how to record spike read coverage (max or mean)? (max)
#' @param dupe      unique (FALSE), duplicte (TRUE), or all (NA) reads? (FALSE)
#' @param paired    restrict coverage to that from properly paired reads? (TRUE)
#' @param standard  restrict non-spike contigs to "standard" chromosomes? (TRUE)
#' @param ...       additional arguments to pass to scanBamFlag() 
#' 
#' @return          a CompressedGRangesList with bin- and spike-level coverage

#' sb <- system.file("extdata", "example.spike.bam", package="spiky", 
#'                   mustWork=TRUE)
#' res <- scan_spiked_bam(sb, bins=GRanges())
#' summary(res$spikes$coverage)
#' 
#' @details
#'   For a more realistic example (not run), one might do something like:
#'
#'   data(spike, package="spiky"); 
#'   bam <- "2021_ctl.hg38_withSpikes.bam";
#'   ssb_res <- scan_spiked_bam(bam, mapq=20, spikes=spike);
#' 
#'   An extract from the resulting `ssb_res` object is available via
#' 
#'   data(ssb_res, package="spiky");
#' 
#'   The full ssb_res is a GRangesList object with 300bp-binned coverage on the 
#'   standard (chr1-22, chrX, chrY, chrM) chromosomes (as determined by the
#'   GenomeInfoDb::standardChromosomes() function against the assembly defined
#'   in the BAM or CRAM file, by default; if desired, a user can scan all 
#'   genomic contigs by setting standard=FALSE when calling the function). 
#'   By default, the mean base-level coverage of genomic bins is reported, 
#'   and the maximum spike-level coverage is reported, though this can also 
#'   be adjusted as needed. The results then inform the reliability of
#'   measurements from replicate samples in multiple labs, as well as the 
#'   adjusted quantitative coverage in each bin once the absolute quantity
#'   of captured cell-free methylated DNA has been fit by model_glm_pmol and 
#'   predict_pmol. In some sense, this function converts BAMs/CRAMs into usable 
#'   data structures for high-throughput standardized cfMeDIP experiments.
#' 
#'   The data extract used in other examples is the same as the full version,
#'   with the sole difference being that genomic bins are limited to chr22.
