#' spike-in contig properties for Sam's cfMeDIP spikes
#'
#' A DataFrame with sequence, concentration, and other properties of Sam's

#' scan_spiked_bam results from a merged cfMeDIP CRAM file (chr22 and spikes)
#'
#' A CompressedGRangesList object with `genomic` (chr22) and `spikes` coverage,
#' binned every 300bp for the genomic contigs then averaged across the bin, and
#' summarized for each spike contig as (the default) `max` coverage. (In other
#' words, the default output of scan_spiked_bam, restricted to a small enough
#' set of genomic regions to be practical for examples.) This represents what
#' most users will want to generate from their own merged BAMs or CRAMs, and 
#' is used repeatedly in downstream examples throughout the package.
