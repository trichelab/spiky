#' for CRAM files, a FASTA reference is required to decode; this builds that
#' 
#' If the contigs in a CRAM have even slightly different names from those in
#' the reference, decoding will fail.  In some cases there are multiple names
#' for a given contig (which raises the question of whether to condense them),
#' and thus the same reference sequence decodes multiple contig names. 
#' 
#' This function simply generates an appropriate spike reference for a CRAM,
#' using the CRAM headers to figure out which references are used for which. 
#' At the moment, CRAM support in Rsamtools only exists in the GitHub branch:
#' 
#' BiocManager::install("Bioconductor/Rsamtools@cram") 
#'
#' Using other versions of Rsamtools will yield an error on CRAM files.
#' 
#' Note that for merged genomic + spike reference BAMs/CRAMs, this function 
#' will only attempt to generate a FASTA for the spike contigs, not reference.
#' If your reference contigs are screwed up, talk to your sequencing people, 
#' and keep better track of the FASTA reference against which you compress!
