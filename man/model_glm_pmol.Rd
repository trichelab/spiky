\title{Build a generalized linear model from spike-ins to correct bias in cfMeDIP}
\usage{
model_glm_pmol(x, conc = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data w/frag_grp, id, and read_count; or scan_spiked_bam result}

\item{conc}{concentration for each spike (will be referenced if NULL)}

\item{...}{other arguments to pass to \code{glm} (e.g. \code{family})}
}
\value{
\preformatted{   the model fit for the data
}
}
\description{
formerly '2020_model_glm_fmol'.  Note that everything in x can be had from
a BAM/CRAM with spike contigs named as frag_grp (len_CpGs_GC) in the index
and in fact that is what scan_spiked_bam now does.
}
\examples{

data(spike_read_counts)
fit1 <- model_glm_pmol(spike_read_counts) 

data(ssb_res) # scan_spiked_bam result
fit2 <- model_glm_pmol(ssb_res)

}
