\title{QC, QA, and processing for a new spike database}
\usage{
process_spikes(fasta, methylated = 0, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{fasta}{fasta file (or GRanges or DataFrame) w/spike sequences}

\item{methylated}{whether CpGs in each are methylated (0 or 1, default 0)}

\item{...}{additional arguments, e.g. kernels (currently unused)}
}
\value{
\preformatted{         a DataFrame suitable for downstream processing 
}
}
\description{
Sequence feature verification: never trust anyone, least of all yourself.
}
\details{
GCfrac is the GC content of spikes as a proportion instead of a percent.
OECpG is (observed/expected) CpGs (expectation is 25\% of GC dinucleotides).
}
