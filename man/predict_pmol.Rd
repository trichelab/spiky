\title{predict picomoles of DNA from a fit and read counts (coverage)}
\usage{
predict_pmol(fit, ssb_res, bsgenome = NULL, ret = c("gr", "df"))
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{result of model_glm_pmol}

\item{ssb_res}{the data / new data}

\item{bsgenome}{BSgenome name (if null, will guess from ssb_res)}

\item{ret}{return a data.frame ("df") or GRanges ("gr")?  ("gr")}
}
\value{
object with read count, fraglen, GC\%, CpG**(1/3), and concentration
}
\description{
FIXME: this could be made MUCH faster by precomputing CpG/GC stats per bin
}
\details{
Using GRanges as the return value is (perhaps counterintuitively) \emph{much}
faster than the data.frame, since the sequence of the bins gets converted
from a BSgenome representation to characters in the latter (it is implied
by the bin start, stop, and genome when left as a GRanges).
}
\examples{

data(ssb_res)
fit <- model_glm_pmol(covg_to_df(ssb_res)) 
preddf <- predict_pmol(fit, ssb_res, ret="df") 
pred <- predict_pmol(fit, ssb_res, ret="gr") 
bin_pmol(pred)

}
