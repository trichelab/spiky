\title{find spike-in seqlevels in an object \code{x}, where !is.null(seqinfo(x))}
\usage{
find_spike_contigs(x, spike = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{something with seqlevels}

\item{spike}{a DataFrame with spike-in information, if not using defaults}
}
\value{
\preformatted{   indices of which contigs in seqlevels(x) are spike-in contigs
}
}
\description{
Find the spike-like contigs in a BAM with both natural and spiked contigs.
This started out as glue in some other functions and got refactored out.
}
\details{
The indices have an attribute "mappings", which is a character vector
such that attr(find_spike_contigs(x), "mappings") == standardized
for all contig names in the CRAM/BAM/whatever, and standardized is
the rowname in \code{spike} that corresponds to the original contig name.
